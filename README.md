## Glossary

Connection, packet. 

### Network Interfaces.

**LAN** – Local Area Network

**WAN** – Wide Area Network


Protocol – set of rules and standards that define a language that devices can use to communicate.

### Low level protocols: 

**TCP** is connection-orientated protocol. This means **TCP** will attempt to establish the three-way handshake.

**UDP** is a connectionless protocol. **UDP** is usually faster than **TCP** communication. 

**IP** – unique on each network and they allow machines to address each other across a network The most common implementation today is IPv4 addresses, which follow the pattern "123.123.123.123".

**ICMP** – stands for internet control message protocol. It is used to send messages between devices to indicate their availability or error conditions.

### Application layer protocols:

**HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol) – an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.

**DNS** is basically the phone book of the internet. It is an application layer protocol used to provide a human-friendly naming mechanism for internet resources.


**SSH** (Secure SHell) – encrypted protocol implemented in the application layer that can be used to communicate with a remote server in a secure way.

**TLS/SSL** – 

Port – address on a single machine that can be tied to a specific piece of software.
Firewall – program that decides whether traffic from a server be allowed.

**NAT** – Network Access Translation. It’s a way to repackage and send incoming requests to a routing server to devices or servers on a **LAN**.

**VPN** – Virtual Private Network. It means connecting separate **LAN**s, while maintaining privacy.

**TCP/IP** Model
Most commonly known as the Internet protocol suite. It defines the four separate layers:
- Application – create and trasmit user data between applications. Here are peers.
- Transport – communication between processes.
- Internet – transport data from node to node in a network. Here are IP adresses
- Link – connection between neighbouring nodes to send data.




**TLD** – Top Level Domain

**RFID**s (Radio frequency identification) – can be placed in or on objects to track them or monitor sensors for many conditions.
